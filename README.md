# Steps


The purpose of this app is to help not only musicians but anyone who wants to develop and train their ears in order to be able to identify different musical intervals.

Steps is orginally developed for music therapy students to help train their ears in an entertaining and fun way.

This app will enable people to show case their ear training skills by playing a game against themselves or others, hone their ear training by being able to listen to what each interval sounds like, and compose different intervals on a piano.


## Behind the App

This is a team project that was developed over a course of three 8-week classes. After multiple fails and the realization that we lack the skills to fully develop this app in time, as a team, we decided to completely scrap the app and start over. We decided that the key function of the app was to help ear train music threapy students, so we put all of our focus just into that - creating the keyboard. Although this ended up being a very simple piano app, we accomplished and learned so much from making this app.

The original design for this app was for the users to be quized over different pitches in a competitive game-like manner. By making it into a fun and interactive game, we hope that it would motivate students to learn. We wanted users to be able to select an ear training ("game") option and a keyboard option.

What this app taught us:
- Importing audio
- Communication between the client and the developers
- Committing on Github
